# TODO

1. __CSS :__ Right now the interface is really ugly.
2. __Add other options :__ It would be interseting to use more options for the operations.
3. __Redo the result text :__ Not satisfied of the current one. *Giving more information would be better*
4. __Simplify some function :__ Some commands seems to be unnecessary too hard and complex.
5. __Port as an application:__ To train a bit more on different langage and plateform.
6. __Port in PHP:__ Might be interesting to see how it could goes.
